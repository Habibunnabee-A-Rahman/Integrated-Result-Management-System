Integrated Result Management System (IRMS) is a Java-based desktop application for managing and analyzing results in an Outcome-Based Education (OBE) system. Designed for teachers, it allows setting custom Course-Level Outcomes (CLOs) per semester linked to Program-Level Outcomes (PLOs), creating exam questions, entering student marks, and generating course-wise, student-wise, and batch-wise reports in Excel format. The system covers all aspects of result management—including university, department, program, teacher, student, syllabus, and course registration—while ensuring secure, encrypted access and cross-platform compatibility via Java.
